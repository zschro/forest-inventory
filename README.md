# Sample Forest Inventory Application
A simple react and flask app to display information about forests

## React App
The react app was bootstrapped with create-react-app and styled using material-ui.

## Flask App
This is my first python-based API. I used SQLAlchemy as an ORM. If I had more time I would like to add a testing framework around this as well.
